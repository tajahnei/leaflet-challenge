The USGS provides realtime earthquake data , updated every 5 minutes. The chosen dataset for this visualization contains all earthquakes from the past 7 days. A second data set from USGS illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

My web application uses an api from Mapbox to build an interactive map so the user has to fill in their own API key in a config.js file.
